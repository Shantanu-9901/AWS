# AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)
## Objective:
To securely manage access to AWS services and resources. You'll create users, groups, and roles, and define access policies.

Step 1: Create IAM Users
Go to IAM Dashboard:

Log in to the AWS Management Console.

Navigate to IAM by searching for it in the "Find Services" bar.

Create a New User:

In the IAM dashboard, go to the Users section.

Click on Add user at the top of the page.

Configure User:

Enter a User name (e.g., testUser).

Select Access type (you can choose both Programmatic access for AWS CLI/API access and AWS Management Console access for console access).

Set a Console password (choose a password or auto-generate one).

Click Next: Permissions.

Set Permissions:

Add user to group: Select a predefined group (e.g., AdminAccess) or create a new group and assign permissions.

Attach policies directly: Alternatively, select from existing policies such as AdministratorAccess, ReadOnlyAccess, etc.

Next: Tags (optional) – Tags can be used to organize and manage resources, but it’s optional.

Next: Review – Review your settings.

Create User:

Click Create user.

Note the User credentials (Access key ID, Secret access key, and Console URL).

Download Credentials:

Download the .csv file with credentials or copy the credentials and save them securely.

Step 2: Create IAM Groups
Go to IAM Groups:

In IAM Dashboard, go to Groups and click Create New Group.

Configure Group:

Enter a Group name (e.g., AdminGroup).

Select existing policies to assign to the group (e.g., AdministratorAccess).

Add Users to Group:

After creating the group, you can add existing users to it by selecting the group and clicking on Add users.

Select the users to add to the group and click Add users.

Step 3: Create IAM Roles
Go to IAM Roles:

In IAM Dashboard, go to Roles and click Create role.

Select Trusted Entity:

Choose the trusted entity. For example, if you’re creating a role for EC2, select AWS service > EC2.

Attach Permissions:

Attach the required policies to the role (e.g., AmazonEC2FullAccess).

Review and Create:

Provide a Role name (e.g., EC2AdminRole).

Review the role and click Create role.

Step 4: Attach IAM Policies
Go to IAM Policies:

In IAM Dashboard, go to Policies and click Create Policy.

Choose Permissions:

Use the visual editor to choose permissions for your policy or write it manually in JSON format.

Review and Attach Policy:

Give the policy a name and description.

Attach the policy to users, groups, or roles.

Step 5: Test IAM Permissions
IAM Policy Simulator:

Use the IAM Policy Simulator (found under IAM > Policy Simulator) to test the permissions of users/roles.

Choose the user/role, select actions (e.g., s3:ListBucket), and simulate the policy's effect.
